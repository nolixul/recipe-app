# recipe-app
An app that you can put your weekly meals in and get a shopping list for ingredients.

## Intended functionality
### Initial goals
- Able to input recipes that we use on a weekly basis:
    - Can add ingredients
    - Can add quantities of ingredients
    - Can add how many servings it makes
    - Can add calories/nutrition

- Able to get a shopping list:
    - Can select recipes that will go into shopping list
    - Can select quantities of that recipe (helpful if you want to make more food/meal prep)
    - Can get a shopping list generated that includes all ingredients you need
    - Can remove items you already have
    - Can add new items

### Future functionality
- Able to save/update a pantry so you don't have to manually check what ingredients you already have:
    - When you save a shopping list, it removes items from your pantry that you will use
- Able to meal plan for the week:
    - Can see what meals are planned for what days
    - Can see calorie/nutrition information
    - Can see who is cooking that night
- Able to add instructions to recipes

## Journey
- Set up app using quick tutorial for typescript and tailwind - tested, pushed.
